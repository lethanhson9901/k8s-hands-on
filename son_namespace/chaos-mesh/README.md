# Getting Started with Chaos Mesh

Chaos Mesh is a powerful chaos engineering tool that allows developers to simulate various types of chaos experiments in Kubernetes environments. It helps in identifying and fixing potential issues with the system resilience. This guide will walk you through the process of installing Chaos Mesh in your cluster.

## Overview

For more detailed information about Chaos Mesh and its capabilities, please visit the [Chaos Mesh documentation](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A Kubernetes cluster
- Helm 3 installed

## Installation

To install Chaos Mesh, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Chaos Mesh Helm repository**:

```bash
helm repo add chaos-mesh https://charts.chaos-mesh.org
```

2. **Create a namespace for Chaos Mesh**:

```bash
kubectl create ns chaos-mesh
```

3. **Install Chaos Mesh using Helm**:

Specify the runtime and socket path according to your cluster's configuration. The following command installs Chaos Mesh with `containerd` as the runtime:

```bash
helm install chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh -n=chaos-mesh --set chaosDaemon.runtime=containerd --set chaosDaemon.socketPath=/run/containerd/containerd.sock --version 2.6.3
```

4. **Verify the installation**:

To check if Chaos Mesh has been installed successfully, you can list the pods in the `chaos-mesh` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get po -n chaos-mesh
```

You should see the pods related to Chaos Mesh running.

## Exploring Chaos Mesh

To get a deeper understanding of how Chaos Mesh works and to start your first chaos experiment, you can describe one of the Chaos Mesh components. For example, to describe the `chaos-controller-manager` pod:

```bash
kubectl describe po -n chaos-mesh chaos-controller-manager-69fd5c46c8-xlqpc
```

This command will give you detailed information about the pod and its current state.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Chaos Mesh installed, you can start creating your own chaos experiments to test the resilience of your applications and infrastructure. Refer to the [Chaos Mesh documentation](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/) for guides on creating and managing chaos experiments.
